# CARLA UNet

This repo contains my implementation of UNet architecture for self-driving car semantic segmentation challenge dataset on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kumaresanmanickavelu/lyft-udacity-challenge).

## Results

![prediction](https://github.com/rsazizov/carla_unet/raw/master//images/prediction.png)

The model achieves a mean IoU score of ~0.74 on a test set. Possible improvements include data augmentation and longer training.

## CARLA

[CARLA](https://carla.org/) is an open source self-driving car simulator. It allows to run SITL simulations and collect artifical data (including semantic segmentation camera).

## Semantic Segmentation

To put it simply, semantic segmentation is image classification performed on individual pixels.

## UNet

**TODO**
